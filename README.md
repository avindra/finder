# finder

**finder** is a new application for an aging Internet user. It takes some old ideas and packages them into a single executable to make using the modern (2021) Internet easier to use.

*finder* is a working title and will likely change in the future.

## Requirements

Currently built using JavaScript, runs in Deno and the browser.


## Roadmap

Future releases as bookmarklets.
